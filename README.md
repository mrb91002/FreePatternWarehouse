#Free Pattern Warehouse
###https://mrb91002-freepatternwarehouse.herokuapp.com/

A crafting pattern application that is designed to promote open source crafting innovations while simultaneously increasing brand recognition and viewership of individual crafters.

##Primary user:
Primary user Christine. Christine is a middle age crafter who is looking for crafting ideas and patterns for gifts.  She has found a number of different sites that require her to create a profile and purchase it. Christine doesn't like having to pay for crafting patterns let alone log in and download something so she tries to find the crafting pattern through blogs which is tedious and wastes hours.  Christine just wants to find a crafting pattern for free, print it out and move on.

##What problem does it solve?
Free Pattern Warehouse is designed for users just like Christine who would like to search for a pattern, print it without downloading and leave the site.  It also gives individual crafters the opportunity to promote their crafting blogs or their personal business sites.

This project promotes the artists by allowing linking from Free Pattern Warehouse to a artists site by a link on the artists profile page.  The artists website can also be found directly on the pattern and after the user has printed out the pattern it can be found prominently at the top of the print out.

##What external API's does the site use?
This site uses the Cloudinary API for image storage.

##What technologies does the project utilize?
It also uses several primary technologies including: JSON Web Tokens, ReactJS, PostgreSQL, Material-UI and Materialize, Babel with Brunch, Axios HTTP Library.

##What was the most valuable piece of user feedback you received?
- Too much scrolling was needed on each crafting pattern to view images.  This was solved by creating modal links that correlate to the proper image so no extra scrolling is required.

##What was the biggest technical challenge you had to overcome?
Connecting to Cloudinary so the images could be stored and and the proper URL could be sent back and stored on Free Pattern Warehouse's database.
